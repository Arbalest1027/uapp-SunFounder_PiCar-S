Place all the code in this folder to /example
To run
```
make
```
then
```
Python3 pid_line_follower.py -v -t 100
```

Some part of this code was used from the pid_shared folder. Make sure you have wiringPi installed in your device. I shall modify, improve this code once the basic test are 
finished and successful. 
Once placed an obstacle, this code should have a faster detection.
