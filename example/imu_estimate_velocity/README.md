Introduction
------------
1. Simply use python3 filename to run the codes
2. Use the calibration code and follow the instruction on the screen to calibrate the sensor before any data reading.
3. Make sure after calibration, only z has positive +1g reading. Others should be 0g.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46531040/139595621-b441418d-2dfe-424c-a279-6117e4192e60.png)

4. imu_test is a light-weight calculation program that does not performs the best.
5. accelaration_integration file performs decent

Limitations
------------
1. Still need some speed to make measurement accurate but still out peforms ultrasonic sensor
2. Might be slow at some time
